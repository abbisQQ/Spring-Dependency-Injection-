# Spring-Dependency-Injection

DI is a technique for passing dependencies into an objectâ€™s constructor. If the object has been loaded from the container, then its dependencies will be automatically supplied by the container. This allows you to consume a dependency without having to manually create an instance. This reduces coupling and gives you greater control over the lifetime of object instances.
